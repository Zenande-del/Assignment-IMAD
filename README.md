The purpose of an app that helps you determine what food to eat during the day is to simplify the decision-making process when it comes to meals. It can offer suggestions based on your preferences, what ingredients you have on hand, or your current cravings. By taking the hassle out of meal planning, the app saves time and effort, making it easier to decide what to eat without the need for constant thinking or stress over choices. It can also suggest new recipes, help with grocery shopping lists, and even assist in trying out new cuisines, making meal times more enjoyable and less of a chore.
